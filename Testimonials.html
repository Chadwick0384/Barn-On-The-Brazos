  			To start with Cathy and Curtis are the BEST people. There are not two better people on this planet to own a wedding venue. You can really tell they do this because they love it, and they love seeing everyone's happily ever after moment. They handle EVERYTHING day of. Cathy ran around and decorated day of and honestly made the venue look even more perfect than it alread was. When we first drove up to the venue and saw all the lights on the silo on I told Ryan this is it. We hadn't walked around, hadn't seen anything other than the breathtaking view in front os us and I had already made up my mind. The fact that two of the most wonderful people run it only made it better. I can honestly not say enough about this venue and the people. You will NOT be disappointed and you WILL have the best day ever if you use this venue. We had rain on our wedding day and Cathy and Curtis held out until fifteen minutes before the wedding ceremony to make the call. There was a break in the rain and we actually were able to make the ceremony just in time! They have a room full of decorations and linens to use. Not only that but it comes with wonderful ideas from Cathy. As a nervous (stressed-out) bride, I can promise you that I will never forget how much stress Cathy took off of me that day. I was able to relax (as much as I could) and enjoy the process while she worked to organize and finish the final touches on everything.</p><br>

		  Everything about this place is perfect. From the amenities to the views to Mr and Mrs. Haley; you are truly at a great place in wonderful hands. My husband and I said "I do" here on October 7 and our day and entire weekened couldn't have went better. If you're looking for a place to entirely make your own on your wedding day, pick this place. If you want a place to enjoy your time together, have an awesome time with your friends and family, and create long-lasting memories, pick this place. I can promise you will be so happy you did</p><br>

  		This venue is sure to impress! It's more then just your average barn, showcasing beautiful chandeliers and unbeatable views. The arbor allows for a beautiful sunset ceremony and the silos will light up the party through the night. The owners, Cathy and Curtis, are unbelievably kind and more than accomodating. I can't say enough great things about this venue!</p><br>

  		Without a doubt I knew I wanted to get married here! It was my first and only wedding venue to visit I loved everything about it. Not only is the venue amazing Cathy, Curtis and Boots (the dog) are great!I booked almost a year in advance and I couldn't wait to get married here. If I had to do it all over again I wouldn't change a thing!</p><br>
